I have been working on the **self-assembly problems of polymer systems**, including melt, solutions, bulk and confined systems. The computational and simulational toolkit includes: self-consistent field theory (SCFT), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations.

I focus on the ordered structures casused by the self-assembly of polymers at mesoscale from several to hundreds of nanometers. According to the undersatanding of the mechanisms of the current systems, I purposely designed simple molecules and predict their complicated assembled structures.

<!-- Our research focuses on the **development and application of advanced computational chemistry methods**, including Molecular Dynamics, first-principles calculations, and machine-learning approaches. We investigate the structure, dynamics, and properties of complex materials, with a particular interest on designing and optimizing innovative **materials for energy storage and conversion applications**, such as supercapacitors and batteries. -->

<!-- [**Research interests**](/research/):
- Interfacial structure and dynamics
- Ion transport and diffusion
- Porous electrode materials
- Condensed electrolytes
- Machine learning for materials discovery

We are always looking for talented and motivated students to join our group. If you are interested in pursuing a PhD or Master's degree in computational chemistry, please feel free to [contact Dr. Sheng Bi](mailto:sheng.bi@xmu.edu.cn). -->
